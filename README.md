## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Skeleton Loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) - For skeleton loaders in-app
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - For Countries Data

### Continued development

I plan to work on another version of this app that uses a different approach when it comes to the data fetching. I will leverage the full power of React Router v6.4 in that version.

### Useful resources

- [Organizing Typescript Code](https://blog.logrocket.com/organizing-typescript-code-using-namespaces/) - This helped during development to organize my typescript code.
- [User-Defined Type Guards](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/user-defined-type-guards-in-typescript-fad639e4944f) - This is a good article about user defined type guards in typescript. It helped me a lot.
